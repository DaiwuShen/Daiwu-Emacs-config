## Description
### Introduction
In this repository, I'll save my Emacs's configurations. there are a lisp script and a folder, some file requists are wrote in "__*init.el*__", some other configurations about packages, key bindings, custom functions and so on are wrote in different lisp script files in "__*lisp/*__" folder. I write these configurations in in different file, and use "__*init.el*__" to manage these files, which is conducive to the management of configurations.
### Usage
if you want to use these configurtions, you need clone the repository into your "__*~/.emacs.d/*__" folder, and remove "__*~/.emacs*__" file. Copy the command below to the terminal emulator and press Enter to run: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaiwuShen/Daiwu-Emacs-config
